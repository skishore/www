        A hack of Pok&eacute;mon Silver for the GBC<br>

    <p>If you don't want to read the rest of this page,
    <a href="http://www.2shared.com/file/Szb3QSzk/PokemonPureSilver.html">here's</a> a link to the .ips file.
    This hack builds off Pok&eacute;mon Silver, adding the following features:
    <ul>
        <li>It is possible to obtain all 251 generation II Pok&eacute;mon in the game, without trading.</li>
        <li>There are substantial in-game events based around all the rare or legendary Pok&eacute;mon which were missing from Silver.</li>
        <li>Shiny Pok&eacute;mon - though still very rare - are much more common than they were originally.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Update July 9, 2011:</b> Redditors NethChild and zsghyk found that the trading event was broken - it didn't add the evolved
    Pok&eacute;mon to your Pok&eacute;dex. I've uploaded a new patch which should fix the bug. If you apply the patch your copy of the hack rom, or
    if you replace it with a freshly patched Silver rom, the event will work.<p>
    
    Now, I'd like to state a bit of the philosophy behind the design of this hack.
    I don't claim that the Pok&eacute;mon series ended with generation II. Although I missed Diamond and Pearl, I've played through
    and enjoyed all the other generations. However, I do think that the sheer number of monsters that exists now makes completing your
    Pok&eacute;dex alone with a single game intractible. With that said, my goal with this hack was to create the definitive
    <i>single-player</i> and <i>single-game</i> Pok&eacute;mon experience: a neat, self-contained quest to catch them all.<p>

    The second feature is particularly important to me. The Pok&eacute;mon series has always had an incredible amount of interesting
    lore. Based on the backstory, the creatures have fantastic powers: controlling the weather, travelling through time, and even influencing
    people's thoughts. But Game Freak has done a terrible job of integrating this lore with the gameplay in meaningful ways.<p>

    I think an example will explain it best. Generation III introduced Articuno's signature move,
    <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sheer_Cold">Sheer Cold</a>. This move carries an excellent
    flavor - just imagine the bird radiating cold so intense that nothing can get close to it. But in the game, Sheer Cold was just another
    Guillotine/Fissure/one-hit KO attack, nearly indistinguishable from moves that other Pok&eacute;mon learned. In Pure Silver, instead,
    this bit of lore is expressed in the mechanics of the Articuno event. And believe me, when you venture into the Seafoam Islands cave, you
    will <i>feel</i> it.<p>

    I've implemented and tested all of the events I wanted to include, but this hack is still something of a late beta. I haven't done
    a full run-through of the game to catch all 251 yet, and I'm looking for testers to try to break it. See below for brief 
    hints about finding and solving the new events.<p>
